          <h5 class="card-title">What are the different data types present in javascript?</h5>
          <p class="card-text">There are several data types present in JavaScript, including:
<pre>    Number: This data type is used to represent numeric values, such as integers and floating-point 
    numbers. For example: var x = 5; var y = 3.14;
    String: This data type is used to represent text values. For example: var name = "John"; var greeting = "Hello, World!";
    Boolean: This data type is used to represent true or false values. For example: var isAdmin = true; var isUser = false;
    Null: This data type is used to represent the absence of any object value. For example var x = null;
    Undefined: This data type is used to represent a variable that has not been assigned a value . For example: var x; console.log(x); // outputs "undefined"
    Object: This data type is used to represent a collection of key-value pairs. For example var person = {name: "John", age: 30};
    Array: This data type is used to represent a collection of values that can be of any type. For example: var colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];</pre>

            V8 (used by Google Chrome and Node.js)
            SpiderMonkey (used by Mozilla Firefox)
            Chakra (used by Microsoft Edge)

          <h5 class="card-title">What is JavaScript? And also Explain the histroy of JavaScript?
        </h5>
          <p class="card-text"><pre>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side 
            scripting on the web. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications. 
            JavaScript was initially called Mocha, but was later renamed to JavaScript, reportedly because of a licensing agreement with Sun Microsystems,
             which owned the Java trademark. The first version of JavaScript was released in 1995 and was called JavaScript 1.0. The history of JavaScript
              can be summarized as follows:

            1995: Brendan Eich creates JavaScript while working at Netscape Communications.
            1995: JavaScript 1.0 is released.
            1996: JavaScript 1.1 is released, which adds support for frames and arrays.
            1997: JavaScript 1.2 is released, which adds support for regular expressions
            1998: JavaScript 1.3 is released, which adds support for the Document Object Model (DOM)
            1999: JavaScript 1.4 is released, which adds support for the Object Model (DOM)
            2000: JavaScript 1.5 is released, which adds support for the Object Model (DOM)
            2005: ECMAScript 3 is released, which defines the syntax and semantics of JavaScript.
            2009: ECMAScript 5 is released, which adds support for strict mode
            2015: ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is released, which adds support for classes, modules, and other features.
            2018: ECMAScript 2018 is released, which adds support for async/await, and other features.</pre></p>
